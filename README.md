# P4: Swarms, Flocks, Crowds
*Implemented functions to displays the behavior of the choosing target.*

My target behavior is that I remember I used to feed the fish in a big pond, and when I throw the fish food in the pond, all of the fish will gather and come for food. Also, when the big fish come out, the small fish will run away and they are scared of the big fish. I try to find the resources like pictures or videos of this idea but nothing perfectly matched it so I chose a close one.

The effect I am trying to achieve is to simulate a pond with a several fish, and the player can drop new small fish, big fish and fish food to the pond. Both big fish and small fish will have behavior of Alightment, Coherence and Separation, but more importantly they have behavior of avoidance, which they will avoid the wall of the pond therefore they cannot go out of the pond, and the small fish will avoid big fish because they are scared of the big fish. Also, they will be attracted by the fish food and the fish food will not have avoidance of the wall because they will be faded in the pond.

In my opinion, I achieve the effect that I wanted in the end and the difficulty was that I tried let the food be disappeared once they are touched by the fish but I couldnt find the way to do it therefore I chose to let the food moving forever and gradually be disappeared.
